<!-- My story will follow the trail of a chocolate shop tour in Brussels, Belgium. Brussels is one of my favourite cities in Europe when I travelled there in 2019. The chocolate there was unmatched in its quality, variety and tastiness
 While eating these delicious treats, you are able to walk through some of the most beautiful architecture in Europe. The beer to help wash down the chocolate doesn't help either -->
